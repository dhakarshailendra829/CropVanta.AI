## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **DO NOT open a public issue.**

Instead, report it privately using one of the following methods:

### Preferred Method (Recommended)

- Use GitHub’s **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature (if enabled).
- Navigate to the repository → Security → Report a vulnerability.

### Alternative Method

- Contact the maintainer directly via GitHub profile message.

- A clear description of the vulnerability

## Response Timeline

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work to resolve verified issues promptly.
